Fix for OS X's scroll wheel problem

## Installation

You may download the binary
[here](https://github.com/pilotchute/DiscreteScroll/releases/download/v0.2/DiscreteScroll.dmg). It
runs in the background and allows you to scroll 3 lines with each tick of the
wheel.

It needs to be run each time you boot. If you want this to be automatic you
may go to `System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items` and add
`DiscreteScroll` to the list. If you want to undo the effect you may launch
Activity Monitor, search for `DiscreteScroll` and force it to quit.
